# Lightning Now Workshop

##Exercise 2 â€“ Styling a Visualforce page for Lightning Experience

###Exercise Goals

* Understand how to quickly add the Lightning look and feel to an existing Visualforce page
* Create a custom, scoped version of the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS)
* Add your custom SLDS files as a static resource
* Create a custom JavaScript file to add SLDS styles to the page

###Step 1 - Add the Salesforce Lightning Design System CSS
1. Continue working with the SampleVF.vfp page from Exercise 1.
2. Add a directive to include the CSS from SLDS in the page by adding a new line after the opening `<apex:page>` tag:

		<apex:slds />
		
3. Wrap the `<apex:form>` tag with a `<div>` with a class of **slds-scope**:

		<div class="slds-scope"> ... </div>
		
3. Add the following to the `<apex:page>` tag:

		standardStylesheets="false" applyBodyTag="false"

###Step 2 - Add a custom JavaScript as a static resource
1. Save [**vflex.js**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garazi/LightningNowWorkshop/exercise-2/Snippets/vflex.js) to your computer.
2. In Setup Home, navigate to the Static Resources section.
3. Click the **New** button to create a new static resource.
4. Give the resource a name of **vflex**.
5. Upload the **vflex.js** file that you saved.

###Step 3 - Add a reference to the custom JavaScript to the Visualforce page
1. Add a `<script>` tag to reference vflex.js as a static resource.
		
		<script src="{!URLFOR($Resource.vflex)}"></script>

2. Add `oncomplete="init();"` to the `<apex:actionSupport>` tag.
3. Save the page.
4. Refresh the custom Contact List page in your org.
